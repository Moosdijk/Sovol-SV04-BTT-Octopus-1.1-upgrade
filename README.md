# Sovol-SV04-BTT-Octopus-1.1-upgrade
This repo will house information related to upgrading the SV04 to use the BTT Octopus 1.1 mainboard. 

The goal is to reuse the SV04 ribbon cables. 
For the labels: 
Let toolhead = toolhead A
Right toolhead = toolhead B

The ribbon cables come in colors starting from black and ending in brown.
The first black wire is 1, the last brown wire is 3.

From both the ribbon cables, the connector is removed from the side that has the ends of the ribbon cable removed from the side that faces the notch.
